## 📁 `show_result` Directory

This folder contains the output files and visual results generated from the sales analysis workflows in this project.

### 📌 Contents

- **📊 Reports & Visual Outputs**
  - Charts, images, dashboards, or exported visualizations that summarize key sales insights.
  - Could include:
    - Sales trends over time
    - Top-selling products
    - Regional performance summaries
    - Profit and revenue visualizations

- **📄 Summary Files**
  - PDF or markdown files that describe findings from the data analysis.
  - Tables and charts exported for reporting purposes.

- **📌 Exported Data**
  - Any result datasets saved after processing (e.g., cleaned tables, aggregated results).

### 💡 Purpose

The purpose of the `show_result` directory is to organize all **generated outputs** from the analysis scripts so that stakeholders and reviewers can easily view and interpret the project’s final results without needing to re-run the code.

This separation ensures that:
- Raw analysis scripts remain clean
- Results are reproducible and shareable
- Visual outputs are stored in one place for reporting and presentation

### 🛠 How to Use

1. Run the analysis scripts located in the main project (e.g., Python notebooks or `.py` files).
2. After execution, check this folder for updated results.
3. Open the visual files (e.g., `.png`, `.pdf`, `.html`) in this folder to review charts and conclusions.
